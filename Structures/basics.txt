Is a collection of one or more variables possibly of different types
grouped together under a single name for convenient handling.

Called Records in pascal
        
        Example:
            Payroll record:-
                Different attributes of an employee are:
                    a)Name
                    b)Address
                    c)Social security number
                    d)salary etc.
            This can be a structure.

            In graphics also it can be used:
                a point is apair of coordinates a rectangle is a pair of points and so on
            

            Basics:
                Lets create a few structures suitable for graphics.
                Basic object is a point which is composed of an x and y coordinate
                both integers
    

    A struct declaration defines a type. The right brace that terminates
    the list of members may be followed by a list of variables.
